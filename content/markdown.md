Markdown
============================

This text is written in the `content/` directory to separate text content from PHP and from views.

This text is parsed by an external Markdown parser and becomes HTML.

You can also write plan HTML in a Markdown file. That is <strong>good to know</strong> since markdown might be missing some constructs.
